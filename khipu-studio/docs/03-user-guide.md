Every Khipu Studio project follows a standardized structure:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/chapters_txt/    # Your editable chapter text files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ art/                      # Cover images and artwork
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/                    # Generated audio files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dossier/                  # Character and world information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssml/                     # Generated SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [config files]           # Project settings and metadata
```

### Workflow Stages

Khipu Studio follows a **cascading workflow** where each stage unlocks the next:

## Tips for Success

### 1. Manuscript Preparation
- **Clean text formatting** - Remove extra spaces and formatting
- **Consistent dialogue format** - Use standard quotation marks
- **Chapter organization** - One file per chapter for best results

### 2. Character Setup
- **Be specific** - Detailed character descriptions improve AI detection
- **Define the narrator** - Usually your primary voice
- **Consider distinctiveness** - Choose voices that are clearly different

### 3. Voice Selection
- **Audition thoroughly** - Test voices with actual text from your book
- **Consider the genre** - Match voice style to your book's tone
- **Think about fatigue** - Some voices work better for long-form content

### 4. Planning Review
- **Check AI suggestions** - The AI is good but not perfect
- **Lock good segments** - Prevent changes to segments you approve
- **Adjust segment length** - Very long segments may hit TTS limits

### 5. Audio Production
- **Process systematically** - Work chapter by chapter
- **Use revision marking** - Mark segments that need improvement
- **Apply processing consistently** - Use similar settings across chapters

### 6. Quality Control
- **Listen to samples** - Don't skip the preview step
- **Check transitions** - Ensure smooth flow between segments
- **Validate metadata** - Ensure chapter titles and info are correct

### 7. Cost Management
- **Monitor usage regularly** - Check the Cost tab frequently
- **Set realistic budgets** - Use alerts to avoid overruns
- **Leverage caching** - Reuse audio when possible to save costs
- **Review TTS efficiency** - Optimize segments to reduce unnecessary generation
- **Track project costs** - Keep detailed records for business planning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to generate plan"**
- Check internet connection (requires AI services)
- Verify API credentials in Settings
- Ensure chapter text is not empty

**"TTS generation failed"**
- Check Azure TTS credentials
- Verify voice is available for your language
- Try reducing segment length

**"No audio playback"**
- Check system audio settings
